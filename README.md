# Project Title


## Description

My website is information-based, namely on electronics and why repairing/recycling is a benefit to the environment. The website is HTML/CSS based, which much of it being bootstrap to ensure mobile functionality. 

## Navigation and Pages

The navigation links to three different pages: Home, Goal and About. Each page holds different information about the benefit of repairing. The Home page has a more distinctive look in comparsions to Goal and About, as this page is the first that a user will view upon entering the site. The Home page also boast most information about repairing and recycling, including an informational FAQ and step-by-step section on the steps you should take on repairing/recycling.

The Goal page is of simple nature in design, only detailing about the website's goals and what it wants from the user.

The About page gives a bit of detail of the author of the website, nothing over the top to take away from the main point of the website.
